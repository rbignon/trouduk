Trou du cul (Asshole)
=====================

This is an ooold project I wrote in 2002-2004. The server runs is written in C, and the client is written in pascal.

Using it
--------

I don't remember which version of Delphi was used, and I don't know how to compile it now.

Sources files are here only to read them because that's fun (at least for me).

You just have to launche `trouduk.exe` (tested with wine on Linux, don't know if it works on Windows).

Change the server to connect to, as neither inter-system.net or coderz.info domains exist.

You can use the `symlink.me:5123` public server, or `localhost:5123` if you run TDKD by yourself.
